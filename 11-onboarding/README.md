## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run initial setup

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Usage

Explain how to use the main features of your project.

### Advanced Configuration

Document advanced configuration options.

## 👨‍💻 Development

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature dev`
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests: `npm test`
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
6. Open a Pull Request to `dev`

### Git Workflow

We use a workflow where all feature and fix branches are created from `dev`, merged into `dev`, and then `dev` is merged into `main` for production releases.

## 🤝 Contributing

Please read our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code of conduct and the process for submitting pull requests.

## 📄 License

```
## 🔄 Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use the following workflow:

- `main` branch is always deployable
- `dev` branch is for integration and testing
- Create feature/fix branches from `dev`
- Merge feature/fix branches into `dev`
- Merge `dev` into `main` for production
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/add-user-auth`, `fix/login-validation`

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration
fix(ui): resolve button alignment on mobile
docs: update API documentation
```

## 🔍 Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Run tests: `npm test`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Build successfully: `npm run build`
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Add tests for new features

### PR Guidelines

1. **Title**: Use a descriptive title
2. **Description**: Include what changed and why
3. **Size**: Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
4. **Reviews**: Request reviews from relevant team members

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

1. Search existing issues first
2. Use the bug report template
3. Include steps to reproduce
4. Add screenshots if relevant
5. Specify your environment

## 💡 Suggesting Features

1. Check if feature already exists
2. Describe the problem you're solving
3. Explain your proposed solution
4. Consider alternatives

## 🏷️ Labels

We use labels to categorize issues and PRs:

- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Extra attention needed
- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `enhancement`: New feature or request
- `documentation`: Documentation improvements

## 📖 Git Workflow Documentation

### Team Workflow Guide

````markdown
# Git Workflow Guide

## Overview

Our team uses a development workflow where all feature and fix branches are merged into the `dev` branch, and then `dev` is merged into `main` for production releases.

## Branching Strategy

### Main Branch
- Always deployable
- Protected with branch protection rules
- Requires PR reviews before merging
- CI/CD pipeline runs on every push

### Dev Branch
- Integration branch for all features and fix
- Regularly updated and tested
- Merged into `main` for releases

### Feature/Fix Branches
- Created from latest `dev`
- Named with prefix: `feature/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`
- Short-lived (typically < 1 week)
- Regularly rebased with `dev`

### Branch Naming Convention

```bash
feature/123-user-authentication
fix/456-login-validation
hotfix/789-security-patch
docs/update-readme
chore/update-dependencies
```
````

## Daily Workflow

### Starting Work

```bash
# 1. Switch to dev and pull latest
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/123-amazing-feature

# 3. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"

# 4. Push branch
git push -u origin feature/123-amazing-feature
```

### During Development

```bash
# Stay up to date with dev (daily)
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/dev

# Push changes
git push origin feature/123-amazing-feature

# If rebase creates conflicts:
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/123-amazing-feature
```

### Finishing Work

```bash
# 1. Final rebase with dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout feature/123-amazing-feature
git rebase dev

# 2. Push final changes
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/123-amazing-feature

# 3. Open Pull Request to dev
# (merge feature/fix branch into dev)

# 4. After merge, clean up
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git branch -d feature/123-amazing-feature
```

### Releasing to Production

```bash
# 1. Merge dev into main via PR
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff dev
git push origin main
```

> **Note:** Hotfixes from `main` should also be merged back into `dev` to keep branches in sync.
```
